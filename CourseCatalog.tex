  \section*{CSCI 430 Software Engineering}	 	
  \textit{3.0 FA WP}
  \underline{Prerequisites}: CSCI 311 for CSCI/CINS/APCG majors or EECE 337 for Engineering majors; ENGL 130 or JOUR 130 (or equivalent) all with a grade of C- or higher.

  An overview of software engineering principles and practice. Topics include: agile software engineering methodologies, requirements engineering, test-driven development, software design patterns, MVC architecture, version control, software metrics, and static analysis. Students work in groups to design and implement a semester long software project. 

  \textit{2 hours discussion, 2 hours activity. This is an approved Writing Proficiency course; a grade of C- or better certifies writing proficiency for majors.}
  
  \section*{CSCI 431 Software Engineering Tools}
  \textit{3.0 SP}	 
  \underline{Prerequisites}: CSCI 430 with a grade of C- or higher.

  An in depth look at software development tools and software engineering methodology. Topics include: agile software development, version control, static and dynamic code analysis, bug tracking, debugging, and build management. Students work in groups on a semester long project to understand and modify and existing large open source product. An agile software engineering methodology is used to manage the modification project. 

  \textit{2 hours discussion, 2 hours activity.}

  \section*{CSCI 630	Software Engineering}
  \textit{3.0 SP}
  \underline{Prerequisites}: CSCI 430 and classified graduate standing.

  In-depth study and application of the planning, design, implementation, and management of complex software systems. Topics include requirements engineering, formal specifications, object-oriented analysis, design patterns, and peopleware. Teams of students will implement a large software project using a cutting edge software engineering approach. 

  \textit{3 hours discussion.}
